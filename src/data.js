    question: 'What is the significance of Schrödinger\'s Cat in quantum mechanics?',
    answer: 'Schrödinger’s Cat is a thought experiment that illustrates the paradox of quantum superposition. It demonstrates the idea that a particle at the quantum level can exist in multiple states simultaneously until it is observed or measured, causing it to collapse into a definitive state.'

    question: 'What is the difference between a virus and a bacterium?',
    answer: 'Viruses are smaller than bacteria and require a host (such as a human or animal cell) to reproduce, while bacteria can reproduce on their own. Bacteria are also more complex in makeup than viruses.'

    question: 'What is the concept of dark matter in astrophysics?',
    answer: 'Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that makes up approximately 85% of the matter in the universe. It does not emit, absorb, or reflect light or any other form of electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes and other instruments that detect electromagnetic radiation. Its existence is inferred by gravitational effects on visible matter.'

    question: 'What is the relationship between energy and mass in the theory of relativity?',
    answer: 'In the theory of relativity, energy and mass are interchangeable through the famous formula E=mc². This means that energy and mass are two sides of the same coin, and that massive objects contain a huge amount of potential energy.'

    question: 'How does the cochlea in the ear convert sound waves into nerve impulses?',
    answer: 'The cochlea in the ear converts sound waves into nerve impulses by using hair cells along the inner surface. These hair cells are tuned to specific frequencies and bend in response to the incoming sound waves. The bending of these hair cells triggers an electrical signal that is sent to the brain via the auditory nerve.'
